# Introduction to Tango DJing

Being a tango DJ is about more than playing music—you're shaping the experience of everyone on the dance floor. Your choices affect the energy, the connection, and the memories dancers take home.

## The DJ's Role

As a tango DJ, you are:

- **A curator** — Selecting music that fits the moment and the crowd
- **An energy manager** — Building and releasing tension throughout the night
- **A bridge** — Connecting dancers to the rich history of tango music

## Key Concepts

Before we dive into the technical details, here are a few concepts we'll explore in this course:

1. **Tandas** — Groups of 3-4 songs from the same orchestra and era
2. **Cortinas** — Short musical breaks between tandas
3. **Flow** — The arc of energy from the start to the end of the milonga
