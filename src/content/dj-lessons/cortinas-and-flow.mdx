# Cortinas and Flow

The **cortina** is a short piece of non-tango music (usually 30-60 seconds) played between tandas. It signals to dancers that the tanda has ended and they should return to their seats.

## Purpose of the Cortina

- **Clear signal** — Dancers know the tanda is over
- **Reset** — A moment to breathe before the next tanda
- **Tradition** — Part of the milonga ritual

## Choosing Cortinas

Common cortina styles:

- Rock, pop, or other genres
- Instrumental pieces
- Something recognizable but not tango

Keep it short (30-60 seconds) and at a reasonable volume. The cortina should clear the floor, not dominate the room.

## Creating Flow

**Flow** refers to the overall arc of energy during the milonga:

- **Opening** — Often lighter, welcoming. Build gradually.
- **Middle** — Peak energy. Mix of romantic and rhythmic.
- **Closing** — Can wind down or end with a strong tanda.

Vary orchestras and eras throughout the night. Don't play the same style back-to-back. Give dancers variety.
