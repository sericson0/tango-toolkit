# Understanding Tandas

A **tanda** is a set of 3-4 songs played together, typically from the same orchestra and era. This structure is fundamental to tango culture and something dancers rely on.

## Why Tandas Matter

1. **Partnership** — Dancers choose partners for a tanda. Knowing it's 3-4 songs helps them commit.
2. **Musical coherence** — Same orchestra = consistent style, key, and energy
3. **Tradition** — This structure has been part of milonga culture for decades

## Tanda Structure

A typical tanda follows this pattern:

| Songs | Type | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| 3-4 tangos | Tango | D'Arienzo, Di Sarli, Pugliese |
| 3 vals | Vals | Same orchestra as preceding tango tanda |
| 3 milongas | Milonga | Upbeat, rhythmic |

## Building Your First Tanda

When selecting songs for a tanda:

1. **Same orchestra** — Stick to one orchestra per tanda
2. **Similar energy** — Don't jump from romantic to energetic mid-tanda
3. **Logical order** — Often build slightly in intensity, or maintain consistency

## Practice Exercise

Listen to a full tanda from a favorite orchestra. Notice how the songs relate to each other. What would you change, if anything?

In the next lesson, we'll cover cortinas—the short breaks between tandas.
